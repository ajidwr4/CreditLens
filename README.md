## ❗ The Problem

In traditional finance, access to credit depends on collateral — assets that most people and small businesses simply don't have. On-chain lending protocols compound this problem by requiring over-collateralization, locking up capital just to borrow less than you put in.

**Key pain points:**
- Borrowers with good repayment history have no way to prove it on-chain
- Lenders have no reliable signal to assess borrower risk without collateral
- Real-world credit records (loans, mortgages, business credit) are siloed and unverifiable on-chain
- No mechanism exists to reward honest borrowers with better loan terms over time

---

## ✅ The Solution

**CreditLens** builds a transparent, on-chain credit identity on Creditcoin by combining:

1. **On-chain loan history** — every repayment or default is recorded and scored automatically
2. **Real-world credit records** — issuers can mint verified credit records (loans, mortgages, business) on-chain
3. **A unified credit score** — composited from both sources, used as a trust signal in the lending market

Borrowers earn better scores by repaying on time. Lenders can filter borrowers by score. No collateral required.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Mechanism A — Borrower-Initiated (Request → Offer)
```
Borrower posts Request (amount, expiry)
        │
        ▼
Lenders see Request + borrower credit score
        │
        ▼
Lender funds Offer (APR, duration, expiry, amount locked)
        │
        ▼
Borrower reviews offers → Accept or Reject
        │
        ▼
Accepted → Loan created, tCTC transferred to borrower
Rejected → Lender's tCTC returned via pendingRefunds
```

### Mechanism B — Lender-Initiated (Public Offer)
```
Lender posts Public Offer (amount, APR, duration, min credit score)
        │
        ▼
Borrowers with sufficient score can Take the offer
        │
        ▼
Credit score checked on-chain at take time → Loan created
```

### Mechanism C — Loan Lifecycle
```
Active Loan
    │
    ├── Borrower repays before deadline
    │       → Loan: Repaid | Score: +points | repaidOnTime: true
    │
    └── Deadline passed, not repaid
            → Anyone calls markDefault
            → Loan: Defaulted | Score: -points
```

## 📊 Credit Score System

Scores range from **0 to 1000**, composed of two components:

| Component | Max | Source |
|---|---|---|
| On-Chain Score | 700 | Loan history (repaid on time, late, defaulted) |
| Real World Score | 300 | Minted real-world credit records |

### Credit Tiers

| Tier | Score Range | Access |
|---|---|---|
| AAA | 800 – 1000 | Best rates, all offers |
| AA | 650 – 799 | Excellent access |
| A | 500 – 649 | Good access |
| B | 300 – 499 | Limited offers |
| C | 0 – 299 | Restricted |
